Simplest (1st iteration) Macro Pad, 3 regular keys, 1 rectangular key, and 1 knob for custom/volume control. Literally. Self - Explainatory. But this project hopefully help me gain more insight about electrical and electronic engineering, which im pursuing, and robotics, which im a fan of and dream succeding in.
